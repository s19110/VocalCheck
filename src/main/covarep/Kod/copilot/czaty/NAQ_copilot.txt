How to calculate Normalized Amplitude Quotient when analyzing a voice recording in Octave?
=== COPILOT ===
The Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ) is a parameter used in voice analysis, particularly in the study of glottal waveforms. It is defined as the ratio of the maximum glottal flow declination rate to the peak-to-peak amplitude of the glottal flow waveform.

Here's how you can calculate the NAQ in Octave:

1. **Load your glottal flow waveform data**: This data is typically obtained from a voice recording and processed to isolate the glottal flow.

2. **Identify the peak-to-peak amplitude**: This is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the glottal flow waveform within one cycle.

3. **Calculate the maximum declination rate**: This is the maximum negative slope of the glottal flow waveform, which can be found by differentiating the waveform and identifying the most negative value.

4. **Compute the NAQ**: Use the formula:
   $$
   \text{NAQ} = \frac{\text{Maximum Declination Rate}}{\text{Peak-to-Peak Amplitude}}
   $$

Here's a sample code snippet in Octave to illustrate these steps:

```octave
% Load your glottal flow waveform data
glottal_flow = load('glottal_flow_data.txt');

% Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude
peak_to_peak_amplitude = max(glottal_flow) - min(glottal_flow);

% Calculate the derivative of the glottal flow waveform
glottal_flow_derivative = diff(glottal_flow);

% Find the maximum declination rate (most negative value in the derivative)
max_declination_rate = min(glottal_flow_derivative);

% Calculate the Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ)
NAQ = max_declination_rate / peak_to_peak_amplitude;

% Display the result
disp(['Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ): ', num2str(NAQ)]);
```

Make sure to replace `'glottal_flow_data.txt'` with the actual file containing your glottal flow data. This script assumes that the data is in a simple text file with one column of values.

Can you edit the code so that the waveform data is read from a .wav file?
=== COPILOT ===
Sure! Here's how you can modify the code to read the glottal flow waveform data from a `.wav` file:

1. **Read the `.wav` file**: Use the `audioread` function to load the waveform data.
2. **Process the waveform data**: Follow the same steps as before to calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude and the maximum declination rate.
3. **Compute the NAQ**: Use the same formula.

Here's the updated code:

```octave
% Load your glottal flow waveform data from a .wav file
[glottal_flow, fs] = audioread('glottal_flow_data.wav');

% Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude
peak_to_peak_amplitude = max(glottal_flow) - min(glottal_flow);

% Calculate the derivative of the glottal flow waveform
glottal_flow_derivative = diff(glottal_flow);

% Find the maximum declination rate (most negative value in the derivative)
max_declination_rate = min(glottal_flow_derivative);

% Calculate the Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ)
NAQ = max_declination_rate / peak_to_peak_amplitude;

% Display the result
disp(['Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ): ', num2str(NAQ)]);
```

Make sure to replace `'glottal_flow_data.wav'` with the actual file name of your `.wav` file. This script assumes that the `.wav` file contains the glottal flow waveform data.

The output of the script is different from the COVAREP's implementation of the NAQ calculation algorithm. Please, take a look at the script at: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/get_vq_params.m and analyze what may be the cause of the output differences. If possible, adjust your code so that it matches COVAREP's calculations.
=== COPILOT ===
To align the NAQ calculation with COVAREP's implementation, we need to follow their specific method for extracting glottal parameters. The COVAREP script `get_vq_params.m` includes several steps and specific settings that might differ from the simplified approach I provided earlier.

Here's a summary of the key steps from COVAREP's `get_vq_params.m`:

1. **Inverse Filtering**: Use Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF) to obtain the glottal flow waveform.
2. **Glottal Closure Instants (GCI)**: Detect GCIs using a method like SEDREAMS.
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Calculate NAQ using the glottal flow waveform and GCIs.

Let's adjust the Octave code to incorporate these steps. Note that this is a simplified version and might not include all the nuances of the COVAREP implementation:

```octave
pkg load signal; % Load the signal package for Octave

% Load your glottal flow waveform data from a .wav file
[glottal_flow, fs] = audioread('glottal_flow_data.wav');

% Preprocess the signal (e.g., high-pass filtering)
glottal_flow = highpass(glottal_flow, 70, fs);

% Detect Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs)
% This is a placeholder for GCI detection, replace with actual method
GCI = detect_gci(glottal_flow, fs);

% Perform IAIF to get the glottal flow waveform
[g_iaif, gd_iaif] = iaif(glottal_flow, fs, GCI);

% Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude of the glottal flow waveform
peak_to_peak_amplitude = max(g_iaif) - min(g_iaif);

% Calculate the derivative of the glottal flow waveform
glottal_flow_derivative = diff(g_iaif);

% Find the maximum declination rate (most negative value in the derivative)
max_declination_rate = min(glottal_flow_derivative);

% Calculate the Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ)
NAQ = max_declination_rate / peak_to_peak_amplitude;

% Display the result
disp(['Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ): ', num2str(NAQ)]);

% Placeholder function for GCI detection
function GCI = detect_gci(signal, fs)
    % Implement GCI detection algorithm here
    GCI = []; % Replace with actual GCI detection
end

% Placeholder function for IAIF
function [g_iaif, gd_iaif] = iaif(signal, fs, GCI)
    % Implement IAIF algorithm here
    g_iaif = signal; % Replace with actual IAIF processing
    gd_iaif = diff(g_iaif); % Example derivative calculation
end
```

This script includes placeholders for GCI detection and IAIF, which are crucial for accurate NAQ calculation. You will need to replace these placeholders with the actual implementations used in COVAREP. The `detect_gci` and `iaif` functions should be implemented according to the methods described in the COVAREP repository[1](https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/feature_extraction/COVAREP_feature_extraction.m).

If you need further assistance with specific parts of the implementation, feel free to ask!

The GCI estimation has been implemented by COVAREP in the following file: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/se_vq/se_vq.m IAIF has also been implemented here: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/iaif_ola.m
=== COPILOT ===
Thanks for sharing the links! To align our Octave code with COVAREP's implementation, we need to integrate their methods for GCI estimation and IAIF. Here’s how you can adjust the code:

1. **GCI Estimation**: Use the SEDREAMS method from COVAREP.
2. **IAIF**: Use the IAIF method from COVAREP.

Here’s the updated code incorporating these methods:

```octave
pkg load signal; % Load the signal package for Octave

% Load your glottal flow waveform data from a .wav file
[glottal_flow, fs] = audioread('glottal_flow_data.wav');

% Preprocess the signal (e.g., high-pass filtering)
glottal_flow = highpass(glottal_flow, 70, fs);

% Detect Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) using SEDREAMS
GCI = gci_sedreams(glottal_flow, fs);

% Perform IAIF to get the glottal flow waveform
[g_iaif, gd_iaif] = iaif_ola(glottal_flow, fs, GCI);

% Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude of the glottal flow waveform
peak_to_peak_amplitude = max(g_iaif) - min(g_iaif);

% Calculate the derivative of the glottal flow waveform
glottal_flow_derivative = diff(g_iaif);

% Find the maximum declination rate (most negative value in the derivative)
max_declination_rate = min(glottal_flow_derivative);

% Calculate the Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ)
NAQ = max_declination_rate / peak_to_peak_amplitude;

% Display the result
disp(['Normalized Amplitude Quotient (NAQ): ', num2str(NAQ)]);

% Function for GCI detection using SEDREAMS
function GCI = gci_sedreams(signal, fs)
    % Load the SEDREAMS function from COVAREP
    % Ensure you have the necessary files from COVAREP in your path
    f0mean = 100; % Example value, adjust as needed
    polarity = 1; % Example value, adjust as needed
    [GCI, ~, ~] = gci_sedreams(signal, fs, f0mean, polarity);
end

% Function for IAIF using COVAREP's implementation
function [g_iaif, gd_iaif] = iaif_ola(signal, fs, GCI)
    % Load the IAIF function from COVAREP
    % Ensure you have the necessary files from COVAREP in your path
    [g_iaif, gd_iaif] = iaif_ola(signal, fs, GCI);
end
```

Make sure to download and include the necessary COVAREP files (`gci_sedreams.m` and `iaif_ola.m`) in your Octave path. This script assumes that these functions are available and correctly implemented as per COVAREP's methods.

If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, feel free to ask!

=== COPILOT ===
The `highpass` function is not a built-in function in Octave. Instead, you can use the `butter` and `filtfilt` functions from the Signal Processing package to create a high-pass filter. Here’s how you can modify the code to include a high-pass filter:

```octave

[b, a] = butter(2, fc / (fs / 2), 'high');

% Apply the high-pass filter to the signal
glottal_flow = filtfilt(b, a, glottal_flow);

% Detect Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) using SEDREAMS
GCI = gci_sedreams(glottal_flow, fs, 100, 1); % Example f0mean and polarity values

% Perform IAIF to get the glottal flow waveform
