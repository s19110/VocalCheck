How to calculate Normalized Amplitude Quotient when analyzing a voice recording in Octave?
=== ChatGPT ===
The discrepancies between your Octave script and COVAREP's NAQ calculation likely stem from differences in glottal flow estimation methods, GCI alignment, and signal processing techniques. Here's an analysis and adjusted approach to align your implementation more closely with COVAREP's methodology.

---

### 🔍 Key Differences Between Your Script and COVAREP

1. **Glottal Flow Estimation**:

   * **Your Script**: Uses basic LPC inverse filtering.
   * **COVAREP**: Employs Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF), which provides a more accurate glottal flow estimation by iteratively separating the vocal tract and glottal source contributions.

2. **Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs)**:

   * **Your Script**: Estimates pitch period using autocorrelation, which may not precisely locate GCIs.
   * **COVAREP**: Utilizes algorithms like SEDREAMS to detect GCIs accurately, ensuring better synchronization with glottal cycles.([covarep.github.io][1])

3. **Signal Processing Details**:

   * **Your Script**: Calculates derivatives using simple differencing and may not apply smoothing.
   * **COVAREP**: Applies smoothing techniques and uses more sophisticated methods to compute the derivative of the glottal flow, leading to more reliable NAQ values.

---

### ✅ Adjusted Octave Implementation Aligned with COVAREP

To better match COVAREP's NAQ calculation, consider the following steps:

#### 1. **Preprocessing**

```octave
[x, fs] = audioread("voice_sample.wav");
x = x / max(abs(x));  % Normalize
[b, a] = butter(2, [50 5000]/(fs/2), 'bandpass');
x = filter(b, a, x);
```

#### 2. **GCI Detection**

Implement a GCI detection algorithm, such as SEDREAMS, or use existing tools compatible with Octave. Accurate GCI detection is crucial for pitch-synchronous analysis.([covarep.github.io][1])

#### 3. **Glottal Flow Estimation via IAIF**

Implement the IAIF algorithm to estimate the glottal flow. IAIF involves the following steps:

* Estimate the vocal tract filter using LPC.
* Inverse filter the speech signal to obtain a preliminary glottal flow estimate.
* Estimate the glottal source filter.
* Iteratively refine the estimates to separate the glottal source and vocal tract contributions.([covarep.github.io][1])

While IAIF is complex, it's essential for accurate glottal flow estimation.

#### 4. **Compute NAQ**

For each glottal cycle:([GitHub][2])

* **AC Flow Amplitude**: Calculate the peak-to-peak amplitude of the estimated glottal flow.

* **Fundamental Period (T₀)**: Determine the duration between consecutive GCIs.([Academia][3])

* **Maximum Negative Derivative (dU/dt|max)**: Compute the first derivative of the glottal flow and find its maximum negative value. Apply smoothing as needed to reduce noise.

Then, calculate NAQ as:

```octave
NAQ = ac_amplitude / (T0 * dUdt_max);
```

---

### 🧠 Additional Tips

* **Smoothing**: Apply smoothing to the glottal flow derivative to mitigate the effects of noise.

* **Frame Selection**: Ensure that the analysis is performed on stable voiced segments to obtain reliable NAQ measurements.

* **Validation**: Compare your results with COVAREP's outputs on the same data to validate your implementation.

---

By incorporating these adjustments, your Octave implementation should yield NAQ values more consistent with those produced by COVAREP.

The GCI estimation has been implemented by COVAREP in the following file: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/se_vq/se_vq.m IAIF has also been implemented here: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/iaif_ola.m
Please check those implementations and generate a full script that calculates NAQ in accordance with COVAREP's calculations.
=== ChatGPT ===
The COVAREP implementation of NAQ relies on two key components:

1. **Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs)** — accurately estimated using the `se_vq.m` function, which applies the SEDREAMS algorithm to detect instants of significant excitation.
2. **Glottal Flow Estimation** — performed using `iaif_ola.m`, a version of the Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF) technique applied in an OverLap-Add framework for continuous speech.

Since I couldn’t directly access the code contents due to a service error, I’ll reconstruct a **NAQ-compliant script in Octave** based on COVAREP methodology.

## ✅ Octave-Compatible NAQ Estimation Script (COVAREP-style)

> **Note**: This is a simplified and adapted version assuming you have GCI locations and IAIF implemented. You may need to port some MATLAB functions for full compatibility.

```octave
% Load audio
[x, fs] = audioread("voice_sample.wav");
x = x / max(abs(x));  % Normalize

% === Step 1: GCI Detection (use your port of se_vq.m) ===
% Assume 'gcis' is a vector of sample indices of detected GCIs
% Example placeholder (replace with real GCI detection):
gcis = detect_gci_se_vq(x, fs);  % You need to implement this

% === Step 2: Glottal Flow Estimation (using IAIF) ===
% IAIF should return the glottal flow 'g' and residual
% Example placeholder:
g = iaif_ola(x, fs);  % You need to port this

% === Step 3: NAQ Calculation ===
NAQ_values = [];

for i = 1:length(gcis)-1
    start_idx = gcis(i);
    end_idx = gcis(i+1) - 1;

    if end_idx > length(g)
        break;
    end

    cycle = g(start_idx:end_idx);
    T0 = (end_idx - start_idx + 1) / fs;

    if length(cycle) < 5
        continue;
    end

    ac_amplitude = max(cycle) - min(cycle);

    % Derivative of glottal flow
    dg = diff(cycle) * fs;
    dUdt_max = abs(min(dg));

    NAQ = ac_amplitude / (T0 * dUdt_max);
    NAQ_values(end+1) = NAQ;
end

% === Step 4: Output ===
fprintf("Mean NAQ: %.4f\n", mean(NAQ_values));
plot(NAQ_values);
title("NAQ per Glottal Cycle");
xlabel("Cycle Index"); ylabel("NAQ");
```

### 🛠 Additional Tasks

* **Implement `detect_gci_se_vq`** by porting the SEDREAMS algorithm (`se_vq.m`) to Octave.
* **Implement `iaif_ola`** by porting the IAIF-OLA from MATLAB (`iaif_ola.m`).
* Both require LPC analysis and filtering tools, which are mostly available in Octave or can be implemented manually.

The script cannot be run because method detect_gci_se_vq does not exist. Can you detect GCI using the following method?

``` octave
function GCI = se_vq(x,fs,F0mean,creak)

%% Settings
F0min=20;
F0max=500;
T0mean = fs/F0mean; % Rough period length for mean-based signal   

winLen = 25; % window length in ms 
winShift = 5; % window shift in ms 
LPC_ord = round(fs/1000)+2; % LPC order
Ncand=5; % Number of candidate GCI residual peaks to be considered in the dynamic programming

trans_wgt=1; % Transition cost weight
relAmp_wgt=0.3; % Local cost weight

repNum=2;
``` 
removeThresh=0.4; % Threshold for removing false GCIs
search_reg=1.3/1000*fs;

%% Calculate LP-residual and extract N maxima per mean-based signal determined intervals
res = lpcresidual(x,winLen/1000*fs,winShift/1000*fs,LPC_ord); % Get LP residual
rep = RCVD_reson_GCI(res,fs,F0mean); % Get resonator output
MBS = get_MBS(x,fs,T0mean); % Extract mean based signal
interval = get_MBS_GCI_intervals(MBS,fs,T0mean,F0max); % Define search intervals
[GCI_N,GCI_relAmp] = search_res_interval_peaks(res,interval,Ncand); % Find residual peaks
GCI = RESON_dyProg_mat(GCI_relAmp',GCI_N',F0mean,x,fs,trans_wgt,relAmp_wgt); % Do dynamic programming

GCI(GCI>length(x))=[];

%% Remove false alarms as weak peaks in resonator output
if nargin > 3
    GCI = GCI_creak_postproc(GCI,creak,search_reg,rep,removeThresh,repNum);
end

GCI = (GCI-1)/fs;
```

### 🔧 What You Still Need

* `se_vq` is ready (per your implementation).
* `iaif_ola` must be ported from COVAREP: [iaif\_ola.m](https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/iaif_ola.m)
* Supporting functions used by `se_vq`, such as:

  * `lpcresidual`
  * `RCVD_reson_GCI`
  * `RESON_dyProg_mat`

I can help port those next. Which helper function would you like me to help with first?

=== USER ===
When running the script, I get the following error message:
Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP): 0.8329
error: creak(231953): out of bound 0 (dimensions are 0x0)
error: called from
    GCI_creak_postproc at line 58 column 10
    se_vq at line 88 column 9
=== ChatGPT ===
The error you're seeing:

```
error: creak(231953): out of bound 0 (dimensions are 0x0)
```

means that the `creak` argument passed into `se_vq` is empty (`[]`), but the function `GCI_creak_postproc` is trying to index into it as if it's a valid vector.

---

### ✅ How to Fix It

You have two main options:

---

#### 🔧 **Option 1: Disable Creaky Voice Postprocessing**

Pass only **3 arguments** to `se_vq` instead of 4:

```octave
GCI_sec = se_vq(x, fs, F0mean);  % Only 3 arguments
```

This way, the `if nargin > 3` condition inside `se_vq` will be **false**, and the `GCI_creak_postproc` step will be skipped entirely.

---

#### 🔧 **Option 2: Create a Fake `creak` Vector**

If you must call `se_vq` with 4 arguments (e.g., if `GCI_creak_postproc` is required), provide a zero vector of the same size as the signal:

```octave
creak = zeros(size(x));  % No creaky voice detected
GCI_sec = se_vq(x, fs, F0mean, creak);
```

---

### ✅ Recommended

Use **Option 1** unless you're specifically analyzing creaky voice.

Let me know if you want help disabling `GCI_creak_postproc` entirely from the code or modifying it to handle empty `creak` inputs more gracefully.
