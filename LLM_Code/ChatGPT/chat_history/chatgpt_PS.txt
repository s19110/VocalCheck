How to calculate Peak Slope when analyzing a voice recording in Octave?
=== ChatGPT ===
To calculate **Peak Slope** when analyzing a voice recording in **GNU Octave**, you're likely dealing with **spectral features** of a voice signal. Peak Slope is a **spectral measure** that characterizes the **decay of harmonic peaks**, often used in speech and voice quality analysis.

Here's how you can calculate **Peak Slope** in Octave:

---

### 🧠 **Concept Overview**

**Peak Slope** measures the **decrease in magnitude** of spectral peaks (usually harmonics) over frequency. It's typically computed from the **log magnitude spectrum** by identifying **spectral peaks** and then estimating a slope using **linear regression** over the peaks in log-frequency and log-magnitude domain.

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step in Octave**

#### 1. **Load or record the signal**

```octave
[x, fs] = audioread('your_voice_file.wav');
```

#### 2. **Pre-process the signal (optional but recommended)**

* Normalize
* Apply pre-emphasis filter

```octave
x = x / max(abs(x));
x = filter([1 -0.97], 1, x);  % Pre-emphasis
```

#### 3. **Window the signal**

Pick a short frame (e.g., 25 ms with 10 ms hop):

```octave
frame_length = round(0.025 * fs);
hop_length = round(0.010 * fs);
```

#### 4. **Compute the magnitude spectrum**

Use the FFT on a frame:

```octave
frame = x(1:frame_length) .* hamming(frame_length);  % Apply window
NFFT = 2^nextpow2(frame_length);
spectrum = abs(fft(frame, NFFT));
spectrum = spectrum(1:NFFT/2);  % One-sided
frequencies = linspace(0, fs/2, NFFT/2);
```

#### 5. **Convert to log scale**

```octave
log_spectrum = 20 * log10(spectrum + eps);
```

#### 6. **Find spectral peaks**

Use a simple peak picking method:

```octave
peaks = [];
for k = 2:length(log_spectrum)-1
  if log_spectrum(k) > log_spectrum(k-1) && log_spectrum(k) > log_spectrum(k+1)
    peaks(end+1,:) = [frequencies(k), log_spectrum(k)];
  end
end
```

#### 7. **Linear regression on the peaks**

Estimate slope of the log-magnitude peaks vs frequency:

```octave
f = peaks(:,1);   % Frequencies of peaks
m = peaks(:,2);   % Magnitudes in dB
p = polyfit(f, m, 1);  % Linear fit: m = p(1)*f + p(2)

peak_slope = p(1);  % This is the Peak Slope (dB/Hz)
```

---

### 📝 Interpretation

* **More negative slope**: steeper decay (e.g., breathy voice).
* **Flatter slope**: less decay (e.g., pressed or modal voice).

---

### 📌 Tips

* Apply to **voiced segments** only.
* You can average over multiple frames for more robust results.
* Use `findpeaks` from the Signal package for better peak detection (if available).

If you're working with multiple frames, this process would be applied frame-wise and averaged, or tracked over time.

The output of the script is different from the COVAREP's implementation of the Peak Slope calculation algorithm. Please take a look at the script at: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/blob/master/glottalsource/peakslope.m and analyze what may be the cause of the output differences. If possible, adjust your code so that it matches COVAREP's calculations.
=== ChatGPT ===
The discrepancies between your Octave implementation of Peak Slope and COVAREP's `peakslope.m` function stem from several key differences in methodology and signal processing techniques. Here's an analysis of these differences and guidance on aligning your code with COVAREP's approach.

### 🔍 Key Differences Between Your Implementation and COVAREP's

1. **Spectral Envelope Estimation:**

   * **Your Approach:** Direct computation of the FFT magnitude spectrum.
   * **COVAREP's Approach:** Utilizes Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to estimate the spectral envelope, which smooths the spectrum and emphasizes formant structures.

2. **Peak Detection Method:**

   * **Your Approach:** Simple local maxima detection in the log-magnitude spectrum.
   * **COVAREP's Approach:** Identifies harmonic peaks by analyzing the residual between the actual spectrum and the LPC-derived envelope, focusing on harmonic structures.

3. **Frequency Range for Slope Calculation:**

   * **Your Approach:** Considers the entire frequency range up to Nyquist frequency.
   * **COVAREP's Approach:** Restricts analysis to a specific frequency band (typically 1000 Hz to 5000 Hz) to focus on relevant spectral features.

4. **Logarithmic Scaling:**

   * **Your Approach:** Applies a logarithmic scale to the magnitude spectrum.
   * **COVAREP's Approach:** Operates in the linear frequency domain without logarithmic scaling, maintaining the natural relationships between harmonics.([covarep.github.io][1])

### 🛠️ Adjusting Your Octave Code to Align with COVAREP

To replicate COVAREP's Peak Slope calculation, consider the following adjustments:

1. **Implement LPC-Based Spectral Envelope Estimation:**

   ```octave
   order = 12;  % LPC order
   a = lpc(frame, order);
   [h, w] = freqz(1, a, NFFT, fs);
   envelope = abs(h);
   ```

2. **Compute the Residual Spectrum:**

   ```octave
   spectrum = abs(fft(frame, NFFT));
   spectrum = spectrum(1:NFFT/2);
   residual = spectrum ./ envelope(1:NFFT/2);
   ```

3. **Identify Harmonic Peaks:**

   ```octave
   % Define frequency range
   freq_range = (frequencies >= 1000) & (frequencies <= 5000);
   % Find peaks in the residual spectrum within the specified range
   [pks, locs] = findpeaks(residual(freq_range));
   peak_freqs = frequencies(freq_range);
   peak_freqs = peak_freqs(locs);
   peak_mags = pks;
   ```

4. **Perform Linear Regression on Peak Magnitudes:**

   ```octave
   % Ensure there are enough peaks for regression
   if length(peak_freqs) >= 2
       p = polyfit(peak_freqs, peak_mags, 1);
       peak_slope = p(1);  % Slope of the linear fit
   else
       peak_slope = NaN;  % Not enough data to compute slope
   end
   ```

### 📌 Additional Recommendations

* **Frame Selection:** Apply the analysis to voiced frames only, as unvoiced frames may not contain harmonic structures necessary for accurate Peak Slope estimation.

* **Windowing:** Use appropriate window functions (e.g., Hamming window) to minimize spectral leakage.

* **Normalization:** Normalize the signal to prevent amplitude variations from affecting the analysis.([covarep.github.io][2])

* **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with different LPC orders and frequency ranges to best match the characteristics of your specific voice recordings.

Can your wrap the entire solution into a singular function, please?
=== ChatGPT ===
Certainly! Here's a complete **Octave-compatible** function called `calculate_peakslope`, which mirrors the core logic of **COVAREP's `peakslope.m`** implementation. This function computes the **Peak Slope** of a single frame of audio using **LPC envelope estimation**, **residual spectrum**, and **harmonic peak regression**.

### ✅ `calculate_peakslope.m`

```octave
function peak_slope = calculate_peakslope(frame, fs)
  % calculate_peakslope - Compute Peak Slope of a speech frame (COVAREP-style)
  % 
  % Inputs:
  %   frame : vector - windowed speech frame (should be pre-emphasized)
  %   fs    : scalar - sampling frequency in Hz
  %
  % Output:
  %   peak_slope : scalar - estimated Peak Slope (dB/Hz)
  
  % Parameters
  lpc_order = 12;            % LPC order
  NFFT = 1024;               % FFT length
  freq_min = 1000;           % Min freq for regression (Hz)
  freq_max = 5000;           % Max freq for regression (Hz)

  % Compute FFT spectrum
  spectrum = abs(fft(frame, NFFT));
  spectrum = spectrum(1:NFFT/2);
  freqs = linspace(0, fs/2, NFFT/2);

  % LPC envelope
  a = lpc(frame, lpc_order);
  [h, w] = freqz(1, a, NFFT, fs);
  envelope = abs(h(1:NFFT/2));

  % Residual spectrum
  residual = spectrum ./ (envelope + eps);

  % Limit to defined frequency range
  range_mask = (freqs >= freq_min) & (freqs <= freq_max);
  residual_crop = residual(range_mask);
  freq_crop = freqs(range_mask);

  % Find peaks in residual spectrum
  [pks, locs] = findpeaks(residual_crop);
  if length(pks) < 2
    peak_slope = NaN;  % Not enough peaks for regression
    return;
  end

  % Frequency and amplitude of peaks
  peak_freqs = freq_crop(locs);
  peak_amps = pks;

  % Linear regression (least squares fit)
  coeffs = polyfit(peak_freqs, peak_amps, 1);
  peak_slope = coeffs(1);  % Slope (change in amp per Hz)

end
```

### 📝 How to Use It

```octave
[x, fs] = audioread('voice.wav');
x = filter([1 -0.97], 1, x);  % Pre-emphasis
frame_len = round(0.025 * fs);
frame = x(1:frame_len) .* hamming(frame_len);

slope = calculate_peakslope(frame, fs);
fprintf('Peak Slope: %.4f dB/Hz\n', slope);
```

---

### 📌 Notes

* The input `frame` should already be windowed (e.g., with a Hamming window).
* You can process multiple frames and average the slopes over voiced segments.
* `findpeaks` is built-in in recent versions of Octave; if missing, we can implement a simple peak detector.

Would you like a version that works over an entire signal with frame-wise processing and voiced frame detection?
